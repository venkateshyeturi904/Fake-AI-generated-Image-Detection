# Fake AI-generated Image Detection

## Overview

Detection of fake images generated by AI is a crucial task in image analysis and authentication. This project focuses on classifying images into two categories: AI-generated or real images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). I also developed a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for easy image classification.

### Dataset

You can find the dataset we used for this project on Kaggle: [Fake AI-generated and Real Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images).

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

- `real-and-ai/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `app.py/`: Here, you can find the overall application code to start with
- `model_training.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook explaining the model training process.
- `model.hdf5`: The file model.hdf5 contains a saved version of the trained model, which prevents the need to retrain the model each time it is tested.

## Model Development

I have used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The model was trained on a labeled dataset containing both AI-generated and real images. You can find a detailed explanation in the `model_training.ipynb` notebook.

## User Interface

To make it easier for users to classify images, we created a simple and intuitive web interface using Streamlit. You can run the app locally to test the model and classify your own images. To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:
